# Deadline Tracker

Small SQLite + PHP Deadline Tracker for university deadlines

1. Host files
2. Add deadlines (CATS is my university's name for credits)
3. They will be sorted with soonest at the top with a countdown of number of days
4. Profit

Made for personal use 2 years ago, but hey maybe it will help someone :D

*The first word in the deadline name will effectively group it,
so WW2 - Essay will be in the same colour as WW2 - Exam*

The colour of each group is generated at runtime, **meaning different 
colours on reload**, which I thought was cool :D

DISCLAIMER: In no way secure.
